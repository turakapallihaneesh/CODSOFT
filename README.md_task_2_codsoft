Project Overview
The Student Grade Calculator is a simple Java-based program that helps calculate a student's total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade based on the marks obtained in each subject.

How It Works
Input: The program takes as input the marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.

Total Marks: It calculates the total marks obtained by summing up the marks in all subjects.

Average Percentage: The program divides the total marks by the total number of subjects to calculate the average percentage.

Grade Calculation: It assigns grades based on the average percentage achieved.

Display Results: The program displays the following results to the user:

Total marks obtained
Average percentage
Corresponding grade
Usage
Run the program.
Enter the marks obtained in each subject as instructed.
The program will calculate and display the total marks, average percentage, and grade.
