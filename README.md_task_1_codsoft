Project Description: "Guess the Number Challenge"

Overview:
The "Guess the Number Challenge" is a fun and interactive game designed to test your guessing skills. In this project, we've created a simple yet engaging game that involves guessing a random number within a specified range. The game incorporates various features to make it more exciting and enjoyable.

Key Features:

Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100). This number will be your target to guess.

User Interaction: You, as the player, will be prompted to enter your guess for the generated number. Simply type in your guess, and the game will provide feedback.

Feedback System: After each guess, the game will compare your guess with the generated number and provide feedback. You'll know if your guess is correct, too high, or too low.

Limited Attempts: To make the game challenging, there's a limit to the number of attempts you have to guess the number. You can set the number of attempts before starting the game.

Multiple Rounds: If you enjoy the game and want to keep playing, there's an option for multiple rounds. After completing a round, you can choose to play again and improve your score.

Scorekeeping: The game keeps track of your performance. Your score can be based on the number of attempts taken to guess the number or the number of rounds won. Try to beat your own records and challenge your friends to see who can get the best score!
